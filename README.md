H1N1-London-2009
================

The recent article "Capturing the time-varying drivers of an epidemic using stochastic dynamical systems", written in 
collaboration with Kostas Kalogeropoulos and Marc Baguelin, provides with a generic solution to monitor the 
evolution of key parameters as the effective transmission rate during an epidemic. 

The proposed methodology relies on compartmental models in which some parameters are allowed to vary over time
following a diffusion. It then helps to understand what are the underlying and unobserved causes of observed epidemic 
dynamics. We illustrated this approach on a time series of H1N1 cases recorded in London during the 2009 pandemic ().

This repository allowd to reproduce some results presented [in a recent paper][1] introducing a 
generic methodology to capture how key parameters of a model evolve over time under the influence of 
extrinsic factors of an epidemic.
